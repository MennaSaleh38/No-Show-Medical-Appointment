# No-Show-Medical-Appointment
>  Welcome to my Investigate a Dataset Project. Here I will be analyzing data about Medical Appointment No Shows in a hospital in Brazil that states that 30% of  their patients end up not showing up. When a patient sets an appoitment can we predict if a patient will show up or not based on the previous No-Shows history provided in our dataset? Is it the patients fault or the hospitals fault? We will have clearer insights about all this after answering the following questions:

- Q1: Do patients with serious medical conditions affect the possibilty of a no-show?if yes-which has the most effect?
- Q2: Does sending SMS reminders help in decreasing the possibilty of a no-show happening?
- Q3: Does the patient who owns a scholarship tend to have less no-shows? 
- Q4: Is there a specific age group and gender that tends to make a no-show?
- Q5: Does the difference between the scheduled day and appointment day have an impact on the no-show incident? 
- Q6:Is there a specific day where no-shows tend to happen?
- Q7: Which neighbourhood has the highest no-show?
